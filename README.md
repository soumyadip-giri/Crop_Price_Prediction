🌾 Crop Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds a Crop Price Prediction Model using historical agricultural data (rainfall, supply, demand, crop type, and market/district). The model is trained using Random Forest Regressor, which provides robust and accurate predictions for future crop prices.

📌 Features

Simulates and handles crop price dataset across multiple crops and markets.

Encodes categorical variables (crops and markets/districts).

Performs feature engineering (date-based features: Year, Month, Day).

Trains and evaluates Random Forest model for prediction.

Saves the trained model (.pkl) for future use.

Includes an interactive prediction interface for testing with user input.
